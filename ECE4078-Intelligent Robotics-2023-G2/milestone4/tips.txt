1. make robot more stable (lower caster balls) (leave some wiggle room, otherwise too much friction to move)
2. Clean wheels
3. recalibrate wheels (be as precise with the time as possible)
3. find better path:
	i. find the long lines of markers and align them in straight line, align isolated markers with other known markers in a straight line
	ii. map clusters relative to every other cluster 
	iii. don't move too long without seeing any markers on cam, uncertainty will increase
	iv. staying longer and looking at things repeatedly may not increase accuracy

for M3:
planning:
1. either 0.8m straight/0.566m diagonal 45 degrees (to make sure can see whole fruit within frame)
2. 2-3 pics with diff poses for each fruit
3. min 5 max 25 pics
4. >=1 pic with >=2 types of fruits
5. >=1 pic 0.8m away 


demo:
1. align bbox centre line and frame centre line (to get 0 x_shift and horizontal rel dist=0)
2. adjust robot dist until v:0.8m/0.566m
