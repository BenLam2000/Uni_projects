# Overview
The goal of this group-based semester-long project was to build a robot that can locate 3 specified fruits in an arena in sequence autonomously while avoiding obstacles.

# Rules and restrictions
1. All groups had to use the provided robot - Alphabot2, which had a RaspberryPi as its core. Python was the language to program the robot.
2. All groups had to use the provided arena for the robot demonstration, with 10 AruCo markers and 5 fruits that would be randomly placed on it.
3. The only sensor allowed to use is the RaspberryPi camera. All other sensors onboard the Alphabot such as IR and ultrasonic sensors were strictly prohibited. Because this robot didn't have wheel encoders, we had to regularly recalibrate the robot's driving parameters.
4.
